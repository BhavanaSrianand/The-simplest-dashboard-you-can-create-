# The-simplest-dashboard-you-can-create-
Before digging into details of any major project, it is crucial for us to identify varibles at are important for the project and draw some basic insights out of it. This project demonstrates the basics of visual analytics that would help us draw insights from a given dataset.

Data has been collected from 52 countries (developed and developing nations). 

Parameters: Country,	Level of development,	European Union Membership,	Currency,	Women Entrepreneurship Index,	Entrepreneurship Index,	Inflation rate,	Female Labor Force Participation 



Tool used to interpret data: Microsoft Excel

Level: Basic



Author: Bhavana Srianand


# Objectives



1. To identify variables on which we wish to work
2. Create combinations of these variables using Pivot tables
3. Visualise data using Pivot Charts
4. Compile all the data and draw connections between them
5. Generate a comprehensive dashboard







# Identifying variables


Variables of interest: Level of development, Women Entreprenuership Index, Female Labour Force Participation, EU Membership









# Creating Combinations of these variables

With the help of this dataset, we wish to analyse the following parameters


1. Female Labour Force Participation in Developing as well as Developed Countries
2. Women Entreprenuership Index in Developing and Developed Countries
3. Does high Entreprenuership Index mean High Female Labour Force Participation?
4. Countrywise Female Labour Force Participation








# Visualising Data using Pivot Charts

1. Female Labour force participation

# Generating Connections between the parameters



We connect different paramemeters based on
1. Level of Development
2. EU Membership




Use slicers

# Conclusion

This would help us to summarise the data in less than 5 minutes and note basic observations that would help in moving forward.
